Search the map for the very best photo spots all around the globe. Found a spot you like? Great! With Travelscoutr, you can save this spot to your favourites, get directions, fetch physical coordinates and show additional information on either the Flickr or Locationscout website. 

What's more, you can keep the map pinned to your device's location so it shows you spots while on the move! Great for use during roadtrips. By long-pressing the map, you can even make use of Google Streetview to get a sense of the local area.

Travelscoutr currently does not collect nor process your data remotely. Search queries are processed by TomTom. The privacy statements of Flickr, Locationscout, Google Maps and TomTom can be found on their respective websites.
